# Deal_INDIA
This project is based upon E-commerce Website in which frontend is developed using Django and API is developed using DRF (Django Rest Framework) . In this API the response can be used in multiple formats according to development like JSON and XML which can be easily used by any Web Programming Language. It is developed in Python using Django Rest Framework.
In this project we can learn how to structure project in right manner.
Like in this project you can see that the directorie of Rest API and Models of the project is kept seprate so that one can not merge with another and that is main use of Django.
If in future if you need do any change in model then it will keep seprated or in future if you want to develop V2(Version 2) of API then you can use same models you don't need create another models in next API.
